An audiophile currently based in Miami, Florida.

ðŸ“¼ I get interested in any (if not all) aspects of audio, especially if it's related to audio technology. I tend to go deeper to understand and fully comprehend the working of a concept.

ðŸ“¼ As an Electronics engineer, I've grown proficient in understanding how electronic systems and circuits work - and how it applies to the field of audio.

ðŸ“¼ I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Music Engineering Technology from the University of Miami, Coral Gables, where I've had the opportunity to better my software skills and to apply my learnings in the form of designing audio plugins and applications.

ðŸ“¼ Besides that, I am highly intrigued by the field of Spatial and 3D Audio, and how it applies to applications in AR/VR. And that is part of the reason I'm also learning Unity3D while I pursue my degree.

ðŸ“¼ I've spent a good amount of years producing music as an independent artist and as a freelancing composer, with a musical portfolio that includes a huge variety of electronic and cinematic music.

ðŸ“¼ I may or may not have a thing for the 80's and the retro-futuristic aesthetic...
